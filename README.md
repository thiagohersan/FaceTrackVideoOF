Simple ofxFaceTracker example. Eventually we will have video mapped to a face and some special effects triggered by person's mouth shape and other features.

To compile this you need:
- ofxOpenCv (comes with oF)
- ofxCv (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv)
- ofxFaceTracker (https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker)
- ofxFenster (https://github.com/underdoeg/ofxFenster)

If you want to use the Makefile, you'll also need the develop branch of openFrameworks:
